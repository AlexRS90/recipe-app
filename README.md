# Recipe App

## Roadmap:

✅ Created a new rails app. <br>
✅ Followed gitflow <br>
✅ Setup PostgreSQL database. <br>
✅ Created a kanbanboard to track our progress <br>
✅ The app has the following interfaces:

 - A login page.
 - A registration page.
 - A food list (with all CRUD implementation, except for 'update').
 - A recipes list (with all CRUD implementation, except for 'update').
 - A general shopping list view (all missing food for all your recipes and total price).
 - A list of all public recipes from other users with their names and total prices.
